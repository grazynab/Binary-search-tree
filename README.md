# Binary Search Tree
In this exercise I tried to implement a binary search tree by myself, to learn about data structures. Although I did the same with stack, list and double linked list before, it was the most complicated logic I had to build in Python so far at that time.
## What I aimed to learn
- How search tree works
- How to use Python to create something more complicated logically
- More about variables in Python - usage of temporary variables, passing variables to a method
- More about decorators
